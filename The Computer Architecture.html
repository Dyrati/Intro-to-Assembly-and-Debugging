<h1>The Computer Architecture</h1>

<p>A general purpose computer consists of a Central Processing Unit (CPU), Memory Units, and Input/Output ports.</p>

<p>Memory is anything that stores (or remembers) a state.  With electronics, it could be a disk filled with microscopic magnets (a hard disk), or a lattice of wires with fuses (PROM), or an array of floating gate transistors (a solid state drive), or a bank of logical circuits (RAM), or anything else that can both store a state, and output a signal based on that state.</p>

<p>When input and output devices, like your keyboard, mouse, and monitor, are plugged in, their memory is assimilated into the computer's memory, which allows the computer to freely modify the memory of those devices, and/or respond to electrical signals from them.  By modifying specific bytes in your monitor's memory, it can change the color of pixels.  By reading the registers of your keyboard, it can see what keys you pressed, and modify its own memory based on your inputs.</p>

<p>The CPU is a convoluted web of logic gates whose purpose is to process specific electrical signals, and use them to modify its own internal state, and also produce output signals. Within the CPU, there are very small memory units called registers.  Because they are so small and close to the CPU, they can be modified at incredible speed, and most instructions do nothing but modify those registers.</p>

<p>So how does the CPU modify memory?  The output signals of the CPU are connected to the inputs of other devices.  RAM (Random Access Memory) is a type of memory unit that has three inputs (an <code>address</code>, a <code>value</code>, and a <code>write bit</code>) and one output (a <code>value</code>).  Within the RAM, there are millions of tiny 8-bit registers, each containing one byte.  There are also millions of multiplexers used to select exactly one of those bytes based on the <code>address</code> input.  The RAM always outputs the value of the byte at the inputted <code>address</code>.  If the <code>write bit</code> is on, then it will overwrite that byte with the <code>value</code> input.  The CPU uses those inputs and outputs to read from/write to the RAM.</p>

<p>The moment a computer is powered on, the CPU receives an instruction from address 0 of the Instruction Memory (also called read-only memory, or ROM).  ROM is very much like RAM, except that it only has one input (an <code>address</code>) and one output (a <code>value</code>).  The instruction causes the CPU to modify its own registers and outputs.  It could add one register to another, or subtract, multiply, or bitshift.  It could move one register to another, it could use logical operations on registers, it could store its registers in RAM, or it could load values from RAM into its registers.  In some cases, it could produce a pseudo-random number, or even encrypt data.  The possibilities are limited only by the types of instructions that were hard-wired into the CPU.  The instruction itself is made up of electrical signals, many of which flip tiny logical switches, and others get stored in registers.</p>

<p>There is one special register in the CPU called the "program counter".  This register can be modified, and is continuously fed back into the ROM to determine which instruction to receive next.</p>
